# Integration Identifiers

Integrations defined here in integrations-core have multiple ways to identify,
my goal here is to enumerate the IDs and see which ones are available inside the agent once a check has been scheduled.

- Python Package Name
    - `pyproject.toml` lists this
    - this is referenced by `requirements-agent-release.txt`
    - This is always in the form `datadog-<name>`
- "App Id"
    - `manifest.json` has a field `app_id` which appears to match the latter half of the python package name (ie, what is after `datadog-`)
    - Where does this get used?
- Python Module Name
    - Every python check has some module name that is used to import it. eg: `nagios` `redisdb`
    - This is what is used in the agent as "Check Name" for python checks
    - If the there is a "main" python file, it appears to use the name of that file for this.
